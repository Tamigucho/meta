Cross-trainer pokéballs

This idea came today, from another idea I had yesterday: cross-trainer friendships (Pokémon Journeys 072 is one of my fav episodes of all seasons and got me inspired for this)

These brand new pokéballs should comply with brand new rules added to the PC Storage System: more than 1 trainer marked in the same pokéball.

This should happen only when a Pokémon have developed a strong bond with more than 1 trainer before being caught.

Cross-trainer pokéballs are capsules covering standard pokéballs. They transport the containing pokéball to the capsule/trainer that requested it (just like party>PC Storage/Lab transportation)

Selected phrases from NPCs:
Pink & Blue:
- Technology got so advanced, that you can store Tamiguchos in a flat card rather than these big blocks. In this state, they minimize by a lot!
- TamiCards are the tiniest computers, inspired by nanotech. These tiny computers have a processing unit in the main board, a storage unit similar to a RAM memory where tamiguchos are stored as energy, and a battery that is constantly getting energy from the environment in order to charge. Not enough, the surface of TamiCards are e-ink always-on screens!! Welcome to the future!
- People do still use TamiBlocks nowaday. Why? Because it's cool!
- I love TamiCards but I think TamiBlocks will never turn old. My sense does also tells me that Tamiguchos feel more comfortable at TamiBlocks!
- When a single Algalone defeats 9 Algalones in a streak, they merge and morph into Algalthea!
- Humans have too much words for Tamigucho's minds. They appear to be understanding our words but that's more profound than we thought: they are reading our feelings
- Tamiguchos don't go with words, but feelings. Even when they appear to be talking, all they are doing is, expressing their feelings. This means Tamiguchos from very distinct species are able to talk to one another by just understading feelings!
- When a Tamigucho is running away, even if you throw a beam to call'em back, the TamiStorages won't work. TamiCards, TamiBlocks were made to respect the freedom of the creatures.
- If a creature is running away from their tamer, they may have a reason for this. If the tamer forces, their TamiStorage may even get deactivated, and the Tamigucho will be de-marked and return to its status of wild, free to join another tamer... ...or not
- Weakening a Tamigucho to catch it is moraly biased. They should join you by their free will. TamiStorages were updated to be more comfortable and better display the aura of a tamer so the to-be-caught creature can know and trust before even knowing! So, the catch rate has been generously increased in recent updates, while still being moral.
- You can minimize some TamiStorage so it costs less physical space when you're carrying. You can't do that to TamiCards, but you can with TamiBlocks! But, who would need to minify TamiCards? They're already too light!
- My favorite TamiStorage are TamiBlocks! For Taminecraft players, blocks are everything! I can stack a pile and piles of TamiBlocks and they'll look like edifices!
- TamiCards, TamiBlocks... ...what are the standard TamiStorage? No one know, and that's the nice thing about it! The default TamiStorage depends on opinion and personal choice! Variety of options!
- Team Petami want Tamiguchos to capture humans and use us in battles. But I do ask myself: would Team Petami also desire to be captured and used in battles?
- A very powerful Tamigucho from the mugenkizuna region, told me humans are weak, live shortly and are used to combat one another, so one day the world will be inhabited by Tamigucho-like humans and Tamiguchos only
- I would call the Brava region as the side B. There's a region which is side A, the first side. A region which is the origin of the Tamigucho universe. Are you leaving side A to enter side B? Oh, are Brava the side A? Whatever! Just jump and go on, to the next!
- I'm also from the mugenkizuna region.
- When a strong bond between a Tamigucho and its tamer is formed, they can liberate power of all types. This includes transforming and, morphing, too.
- When two tamers and a Tamigucho loves one another, these tamers can share this Tamigucho by using a cross-tamer TamiStorage!
- So, do you know how a cross-tamer TamiCard work? If a Tamigucho shows affection for both you and your friend, you two will put a cross-tamer cover on a TamiCard, sync it with a second cover and launch it. For TamiBlocks? You put a cross-trainer capsule instead of  cover!
- When two people have the same Tamigucho, both will have a cross-tamer cover or capsule. They can't carry the same Tamigucho at the same time, but they can pass to one another according to needs. When calling a cross-tamer Tamigucho from the other tamer, its TamiStorage is teleported to your cover or capsule!
- Are you going to Carnival Contests? People call'em Carnivests.
- Thankfully the Tamigucho universe isn't about battles. Isn't about a single thing exclusively. You can choose any way.
- In Carnival Contests, your Tamiguchos and yourself, your hearts, are warmed and synced to display the fullest of your artistic talent! ❣️
- Carnivests are hosted in most cities, but the best and most competitive happens in the Rioja city only! 🤩
- You can buy clothes for yourself and your Tamiguchos! Although, biped Tamiguchos using clothes is a bit disturbing.
- If you put Stickerffects on your TamiStorage, diverse effects can appear when you launch a Tamigucho. These are more than useful in Carnival Contests! These are beautifly!
- Yes, he've nicknamed our Borboll as "Beautifly". I love how people can be soooo creative! BTW, if you love your Tamiguchos, you should have lovely and special names for them! ☺️
- I come from a very cold place of the mugenkizuna region. I traveled to Brava just for the Carnival! Me and my Butterfreeze are in sync with cold nerves but warm hearts! Ah yes, my Butterfreeze is a Borboll, too!
- We are all close together here because we share the same love for Borbolls! Mine I call Bravuleta, because we love the Brava region!
- Fuse the Butterfreeze and Beautifly names? You'll have the original name: Butterfly!
- Fusing? What about Beautifreez?!
- [Borboll's phrase] {nickname}: booooor!
A & B:
- Technology got so advanced, that a machine to read not only emotions and dreams, but also fully translate what a Tamigucho is meaning, is already available!
- A region that had a war? We call it Warto. The new champion was son of that team's leader. These are some of the data we found in the Temporary city
- mugenkizuna was the first region of the Tamigucho universe, fruit of a space/time distortion. Its origin? Some say it is Mt. Coronoon
- Qrosstum is the only creature known to travel through the multiverse, being cross-universe.
- Qrosstum have a special love for the Tamigucho universe; may it be the cause of space/time distortions and our origin? Some say Qrosstum regularly visits or even lives in Mt. Coronoon, but no expedition ever was able to confirm it
- Qrosstum have so many universes to visit in the infinite multiverse, that I doubt it only have a preferred one
- Team Quantic affirm Qrosstum exist, and some say to have seen it; but no video footage available so... ...legends are just legends.
- Until someone proves it exist, nobody can affirm it don't exist!
- Mt. Coronoon reaches all of the 4 edges of the region. Paradoxically, it is the most accessible and most inaccessible place at the same time.
- You can enter Mt. Coronoon from any place, easily; but on the other hand, advancing on it is hard
- Qrosstum is the most powerful Tamigucho...  ...except that, there's only one creature that can beat Qrosstum, and it isn't here in the Tamigucho universe
- The creature that made Qrosstum? Its name is a mix between Archaic, hmmmm, Ark, and Zeus, according to the fragmented data we got from the Temporary city
- In other universes, probably Tamiguchos aren't known as Tamiguchos. As we seek to explore planets, the next frontier is exploring universes and the time
- Based in data from the Temporary City, in pre-ancient times humans and other creatures were one. If these creatures can be called Tamiguchos, then... ...are humans some sort of Tamiguchos?
- Any TamiStorage, such as TamiCards and TamiBlocks, are charged everyday, everyhour nonstopping! Both by darkness and light, be it natural or artificial, there's no condition preventing the containing tamiguchos from receiving life/energy!
- When you store a Tamigucho inside a card or block, they are converted from matter to energy. TamiBlocks is a primitive storage but still used nowadays that we have tinner, flat cards!
- What happens inside TamiStorages such as TamiCards or TamiBlocks? You wonder; everybody wonders! When Tamiguchos are converted into energy, an environment made of energy is also artificially created, stored in the RAM. It can be a garden, a lake, a forest, a jungle, a sea! If you ask you are right: Tamiguchos are consciously awake inside TamiStorages, so they need a nice environment they love to live in! They don't need to eat as energy, but probably they'll always want to play and rest!
- Tamiguchos can enter or leave TamiStorages at their own pace and will, as they are conscientious inside it, just as they were when inside an egg.
- He's right! Ah, yes, just as they were in the egg: they are aware of everything happening outside, and can even feel the energy and heat of their tamer and colleagues of neighbor TamiStorages!
- Most of the data collected in the Temporary city are in the hands of Team Quantic. Probably they were aware a space/time distortion could make a place or a whole city and eagerly expecting for it. I'm sure they have maps and data of many universes
- A villainous team of the hypothetical Warto region... ...Team Red? wanted to conquer the world. A villainous team of the hypothetical region of... ...Sinnabar? They wanted to conquer the universe. But Team Quantic? They are insane! They want to catch the hypothetical Qrosstum to travel and conquer many hypothetical universes...
- Did I just heard about the Warto and that Cinnamon, err, Sinnabar region? The scientists who studied in the Temporary city, said parts of these regions were merged and became part of our region! Data also pointed that the Tamigucho universe is made of, well, contains parts of a lot of different universes. This may explain why Qrosstum is said to have a so special affection for this region... ...I mean, if it ever existed, in the first place!
- If all of that news are just legends... ...why that Temporary city suddenly appeared next to Mt. Coronoon's Quantum Temple? This was even filmed and covered extensively. But, unfortunately, no one ever was able to record Qrosstum... ...yet!
- Who was able to see the Temporary city? Everyone! But who was able to enter it? Scientists and officers, before they were forcibly removed by Team Quantic.
- Scientists who visited the Temporary city were robbed and had to leave. But they bought their memory with them and we were able to know some things that Team Quantic knows better than us. But we aren't ignorant at all!
- My favorite leaked data about the Temporary city? Is about the Wormorph's relatives in other universes. There are a slimmy thing that is result of an unsuccessful clone, but despite failed both this slime and Wormorph had a library-like DNA preserved. I don't see them as a failure. Some great discoveries were made off failures!
- Scientists don't lose their attention when the topic is about other scientists. They heard and told us about a weird scientist from an other universe. Jimmy, was once part of a criminal group but debanded and turned into a great scientist. Despite being part of a villainous team, they never were truly evil. We look forward to hear more but data is so fragmented and mixed with rumors, that we got ourselves lost on them. Probably Team Quantic knows what is sound and what is noise!
- I don't appreciate incomplete information. That scientist? One of his experiments was teaching creatures to talk! They were also teaching slimmy creatures to be more confident, social and improve their mimicking.
- In our region, even the non-scientists loves to talk about quantum things! Its in our DNA! The dead cat is alive ahoooo!
- Traveling through universes, and traveling in time are the same thing! We heard of a creature called "Celebrant of Times" who was able to timetravel, but never heard of traveling through universes. Probably this creature was able to travel through a single track, in this case a single timeline! But every quantum second that passes, we and our actions are creating new universes that we simply call "time passing". Creating universes is easy, but undoing actions or traveling through them? I've heard only Qrosstum is able to.
- A folkloric, legendary, mythical Tamigucho: they may appear unique but there may be more than one individuals from the same specie. Can they reproduce? They are genderless and most say they and can't. But yes, they can and they do. But not in captivity. Their reproduction is rare even in their native environment.
- If NestHouses, daycares were able to reproduce mythical Tamiguchos, that would pose a risk to the very species and, to all other including humans
- Past, future and present may be mixed in a space/time distortion. At the Temporary city, we got confusing facts about the same stuff but in different timelines.
- Why people are surprised with that Temporary city? Space/time distortions are common in our region, even the multiversal ones!
- There are no "default" and "alternative" universes. Earth isn't the only planet nor the center of our universe. Same about universes: our universe is also "alternative" to other universes, so there's no default. That's relative.
- People say "alternative universes" as if our universe were normal and all others weird. We shall drop that multiversal phobias, bias. Out of our comfort zone, we should accept the fact that our very universe is also weird to the others!
- Probably other universes don't know about the Tamigucho universe. But we are somewhat aware about theirs! That's a nice privilege Qrosstum gave us.
- I was once able to talk Qrosstum! I asked for a multiversal travel but she said only special people can travel with. Qrosstum also said other things, but asked me to be confident so I'll respect.
- I was with him in this day when we met her. She's soooo sweet! We became friends! She transformed into human and we used to walk together! But now she's busy 🤕
- This is the Qrosstum Fanclub! Most of us have met it someday. I took a picture but my phone behaved at its own, deleting the photo
- Qrosstum is very careful about its identity. When it walks between us, it ensures no one who knows it is around, so it won't be revealed.
- A Tamigucho who have other Tamiguchos to tame? Qrosstum have its own ID as a human and can capture and train creatures so as humans can. But no one knows how it got a legit human ID despite being a Tamigucho.
- About Qrosstum, I don't think she's simply a Tamigucho. She may be a powerful human rather than a Tamigucho. As we read from the Temporary city, humans and Tamiguchos used to be one in the distant past. That's why we should treat Tamiguchos with the same rights we guarantee to humans.
- What came first, the egg or the Tamigucho? What Qrosstum are: a Tamigucho who can turn human or a human who can turn Tamigucho?
- No Tamigucho have a license to behave as a tamer and have a human ID, except Qrosstum.
- Ark... ...what is its name? We heard it made a universe... ...or more, and that Qrosstum is "its right-arm".
- Qrosstum's right arm is a pearl, and the left one is a diamond. It is said she uses both hands when opening a wormhole to another universe.
- Music is time. An image is space. You quickly look at an image and you already know it. But for music, you'll have to wait for its entirety to pass.
- Team Quantic is a criminal group; but Team Petami is something more. They looked like a sect
- [DISCS STORE] I love how these media have A and B sides. You can put the same music but in different versions on each side!
- [DISCS STORE] Our universe may be a side A or B of other universes. Yes, I'm a retro nostalgy fan, but as all of mugenkizuna citizens, I'm also fan of quantum science!
- All Tamiguchos are able to indirectly feel the aura of humans. But none is able to see it, as fair as I know. Unless the data from the Leaked city, oops, the Temporary city, could be right.

Tamiguchos favours for Pokémon:
- Expand it
- Show the B side of it, a broader universe to be explored
- Explain some things about Pokémon that aren't detailed in Pokémon itself
- Defend the monverse from the controverses it was involved
-
Merging with or accepting that Tamigucho exist isnt their choice.
We cannot choose if another parallel universe exist or not; simply everything exist; there's a place for everything.

Poke -> Tamigucho to replace:
- TMs/HMs

Challenges of criticism:
- Types (workaround: possible and planned, but challenging - Severity: MEDIUM)
- Atks (workaround: naming+rebalance in stats - Severity: LOW)
- Storage (workaround: stop at TamiBlocks and privilege TamiCards - Severity: HIGH)
- Names (junctions - workaround: ?? - Severity: LOW/MEDIUM)

Tamigucho site:
- Fix the mistakes done from Pokémon (no NFTs for pets like Mew, bias)
- Bring diversity to the already flourishing niche/genre of mon-catching
- Stablish a linked multiverse for interoperability

Tami Journey app (like Pokemon Go, but safer and incentive to travel with the uber of buses!) - this was inspiration from a real life dream I had in the time being, probably early 2022
